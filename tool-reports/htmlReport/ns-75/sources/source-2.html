&nbsp;/**
&nbsp;   Users should extend this class to implement customized logging
&nbsp;   event filtering. Note that {@link org.apache.log4j.Category} and {@link
&nbsp;   org.apache.log4j.AppenderSkeleton}, the parent class of all standard
&nbsp;   appenders, have built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you
&nbsp;   first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
&nbsp;   your own custom filters.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be
&nbsp;   organized in a linear chain. The {@link #decide
&nbsp;   decide(LoggingEvent)} method of each filter is called sequentially,
&nbsp;   in the order of their addition to the chain.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;The {@link #decide decide(LoggingEvent)} method must return one
&nbsp;   of the integer constants {@link #DENY}, {@link #NEUTRAL} or {@link
&nbsp;   #ACCEPT}.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;If the value {@link #DENY} is returned, then the log event is
&nbsp;   dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining
&nbsp;   filters. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;If the value {@link #NEUTRAL} is returned, then the next filter
&nbsp;   in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in the
&nbsp;   chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the presence of no
&nbsp;   filters, the default behaviour is to log all logging events.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;If the value {@link #ACCEPT} is returned, then the log
&nbsp;   event is logged without consulting the remaining filters. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;The philosophy of log4j filters is largely inspired from the
&nbsp;   Linux ipchains. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   &lt;p&gt;Note that filtering is only supported by the {@link
&nbsp;   org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator DOMConfigurator}. The {@link
&nbsp;   org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator PropertyConfigurator} does not
&nbsp;   support filters.
