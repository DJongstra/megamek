&nbsp;     * What is &#39;stubbing&#39;?
&nbsp;     * Stubbing is your when(x).then(y) declaration, e.g. configuring the mock to behave in a specific way,
&nbsp;     * when specific method with specific arguments is invoked on a mock.
&nbsp;     * Typically stubbing is configuring mock to return X when method Y is invoked.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * Why do you need to access stubbings of a mock?
&nbsp;     * In a normal workflow of creation clean tests, there is no need for this API.
&nbsp;     * However, it is useful for advanced users, edge cases or framework integrators.
&nbsp;     * For example, Mockito internally uses this API to report and detect unused stubbings
&nbsp;     * that should be removed from test. Unused stubbings are dead code that needs to be removed
&nbsp;     * (see {@link MockitoHint}).
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * Manipulating the collection (e.g. by removing, adding elements) is safe and has no effect on the mock.
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * This method throws meaningful exception when object wrapped by MockingDetails is not a mock.
