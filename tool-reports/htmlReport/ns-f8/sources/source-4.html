&nbsp; * VerificationAfterDelay is a {@link VerificationMode} that allows combining existing verification modes with an initial delay, e.g.
&nbsp; * &lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; * verify(mock, after(100).atMost(5)).foo();
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * verify(mock, after(100).never()).bar();
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * verify(mock, after(200).atLeastOnce()).baz();
&nbsp; * &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * This is similar to {@link VerificationWithTimeout timeout()} except the assertion will not terminate until either the condition is
&nbsp; * definitively failed, or the full time has elapsed (whereas timeout() will also stop if the conditions is true at any point, as is
&nbsp; * typically the case with never() etc initially).
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * See examples in javadoc for {@link Mockito#verify(Object, VerificationMode)}
